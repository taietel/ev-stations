# EV Stations API

API for a "simple" EV stations search. The API is built with NestJS and uses a PostgreSQL database with PostGist extension to store the data. 
It has endpoints for CRUD operations on the stations/companies and a search endpoint that returns the stations within a given radius from a given point.
#### API documentation
The API documentation is available at the `/api` endpoint. The documentation is generated with Swagger.


### Future improvements
- Refine Typesense search engine configuration and implementation.
- Implement an event-driven architecture to handle the data synchronization between the API and the search engine. It's partially implemented.
### Known issues
- Response form the db search is not paginated
- Both the search and the db search endpoints don't follow the same response format
- Missing grouping of the stations by location in the search endpoint, I think it could be done in code for Typesense search, and return a transformed response to the client
- The search endpoint is not tested - I don't really know how to test the search endpoint
- Missing tests for various parts of the application
- Missing CI/CD pipeline
